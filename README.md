Build-a-Tribute-Page
</h1>
<p align = 'center'> 
  This project was my first in HTML and CSS, it is a webpage that i made on Codepen.io and its much like a wikipedia page. In that case i made a tribute page for Richard Feynman, 
that i idolize, and i listed some of his projects and links to read more about it.
  I dont know if im going to keep going with this tribute page because it was just a test for my knowledge in html and css, but i have some books about him and, if i feel inspired, i will keep complementing it to create kind-of a bio for him in my own way.
